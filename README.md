# Golang Training Course

There are homework solutions for the golang training course:

1. Displays information about directories and files in tree format.

```
    ├───main.go (1881b)
    ├───main_test.go (1318b)
    └───testdata
        ├───project
        │	├───file.txt (19b)
        │	└───gopher.png (70372b)
        ├───static
        │	├───css
    ...
```

2. Makes something like pipelines with goroutines. One goroutine STDOUT is an STDIN for another. For example is implemented using a simple hashing algorithm.

3. Code optimization with profiler pprof. For better performance [easyjson](https://github.com/mailru/easyjson) is used.
